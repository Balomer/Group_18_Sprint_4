# Group_18_Sprint_4

This project is about CRMLY web application. We, as group-18, will test the features of this app and automate our test cases. While doing it, we will collaborate each other via using GitHub. 

All participants need to implement these steps carefully:

1-You need to clone a new project from Version Control using the link that is shared by project owner/git master,
2-Before start writing your codes, you should create a new branch following our common naming convention as following;
US-JIRA ID_FeatureName / REM-1395_Upload
3-You should commit and push your codes after you are done with your recent changes while your head on your own branch,
4-You should create a pull request on GitHub,
5-You should add your review-mate as reviewer, then inform him/her about your pull request,
6-Your reviewer willcheck it then will comment,approve and merge your commit to remote master, 
If you encounter a merge conflict, please try to handle it coordinating with Git Master
After merge is completed successfully, you can delete the branch on Github.
7. Next day, update your master, merge into current and continue from Step 3.
